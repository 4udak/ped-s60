$ Introduction

Ped is an in-phone Python IDE with IDLE-like features. It lets you edit, execute and debug your scripts directly on your phone. Ped features a multi-document interface which means that you can simultaneously work on many files and switch between them at any time. It can also be easily extended using plugins.

$ Usage

The following section describes the usage of all options available in Ped.

$$ Options

Below you will find descriptions of all functions available in the Options menu at any given time.

$$$ Run

Executes the script you're currently working on. Available only if you're working on a Python script [3.3]. The standard input/output will be redirected to the Python Shell [3.4]. The script's namespace will be available in the shell after execution. If the Ask for arguments [3.5.4.1] option is enabled in settings, asks for script arguments before execution.

$$$ History

Opens a window with commands history. Available only in Python Shell [3.4]. The commands history lets you easily go back to, edit and recall a previously used command. Multiline commands are properly supported too. Choosing a command puts it back on the prompt.

$$$ Topics List

Opens a list of help topics. Available only in Help window.

$$$ File

$$$$ New

Creates a new file. After selecting you will be prompted to choose between a Text file [3.2] and a Python script [3.3].

$$$$ Open...

Opens a file browser letting you choose a file to open in the editor.

$$$$ Save

Saves the file you're currently working on.

$$$$ Save As...

$$$$ Save All

Closes the file you're currently working on. If the file wasn't saved, Ped will ask if you want to save it.
The close function is also available on the right softkey (Exit).

$$$$ Close All

Closes all files. Equals to calling Close [3.1.4.6] on all opened files.

$$$$ Export To...

Exports the buffer to a file. Pops up a dialog letting you choose the path and filename. Available in Python Shell [3.4] only.

$$$ Edit

Note. The shortkey does not work on 3rd edition devices.

$$$$ Find...

Lets you search the text for a given string. Pops up a dialog asking you to enter the string. The search starts at current cursor position. If the string won't be found, you will have the ability to start the search from the beginning of the text.

$$$$ Find Next

If a string was found using the Find function [3.1.5.1], Find Next will search for next occurence of this string.

$$$$ Find All...

Lets you search the text for a given string. Pops up a dialog asking you to enter the string. Searches the whole document and displays a list of all occurences of the string. Choosing one jumps to its location within the text.

$$$$ Go to Line...

Jumps to a given line. Pops up a dialog asking you to enter the line number.

$$$$ Code Browser

Opens a Code Browser. Available only if you're working on a Python script [3.3]. Code Browser displays the tree structure of the Python script. Choosing a function/method jumps to its definition in the script.

$$$$ Call Tip

Call tip feature. If called from within function arguments parenthesis, tries to obtain more information about the arguments syntax for the given function and displays the results. If the function is documented, its docstring will also be displayed.

$$$$ Top

Jumps to the top of the document.

$$$ Windows

Shortkey: Pick-Up (the "green" key)
This dynamic menu contains a list of all currently opened windows (documents, file browsers, ...). Choosing a window switches the focus to it. Note that the shortkey to this menu is the green key pressed twice.

$$$ Python Shell

Opens the Python Shell window. See [3.4] for more information.

$$$ Run Script...

Lets you execute a script by simply choosing it using a file browser without loading to the editor. The standard input/output will be redirected to the Python Shell [3.4]. The script's namespace will be available in the shell after execution. If the Ask for arguments [3.5.4.1] option is enabled in settings, asks for script arguments before execution.

$$ Text file editor

Text file editor is used if you open a text file (*.txt) or create a new one. The usage of the editor is simmilar to other text editors in your phone, for example the text message editor. An exception is the function of the select key, which inserts a new line into the text. Note that the copy/paste functionality is available using the edit key (press and hold it for the options to pop up).

Moves up/down one page. The number of lines/page is determined by the Page size setting [3.5.2.1].

Moves to the beginning/end of line.

See the Options menu [3.1] for additional useful functions (some available with shortkeys too).

$$ Python script editor

Python script editor is used if you open a Python script (*.py) or create w new one. It is simmilar to the text file editor [3.2] but include some additional features letting you edit your Python scripts much easier. For example, it automatically indents the lines after inserting a new line (see also [3.5.2.2]).

Shortkey: Up/Down
Moves up/down one page. The number of lines/page is determined by the Page size setting [3.5.2.1].

Shortkey: Left/Right
Moves to the beginning/end of line.

Shortkey: Select
Autocomplete feature. Same as in Python Shell [3.4].
Note that in case of a Python script editor, the autocomplete list contains all global objects and the ones defined by last script execution. The local objects cannot be autocompleted.

See the Options menu [3.1] for additional useful functions (some available with shortkeys too).

$$ Python Shell

The Python Shell tries to mimic the features of the Python Shell found in the IDLE tool (distributed with Python for PCs). Among them are the autoindentation feature (see also [3.5.2.2]) or the line recall (if you scroll back in the buffer and press the select key on some line, it will be copied to the prompt).

Shortkey: Up/Down
Moves back and forth in commands history. See [3.1.2] for more information.

Shortkey: Left/Right
Moves to the beginning/end of line.

Shortkey: Select
Autocomplete feature. Opens a list of objects, statements and some frequently used symbols. The list will be limited to the items starting with the text found before the cursor when the autocomplete feature was called. This text may contain dots (".") which lets you easily autocomplete object attributes. After opening, the list can be limited further by simply typing.

See the Options menu [3.1] for additional useful functions (some available with shortkeys too).
