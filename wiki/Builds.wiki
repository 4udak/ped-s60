#summary Which build should I download?

Ped is distributed in *SIS* files (Symbian OS installation files). Depending on what smartphone model do you have and how do you want to use Ped, you should download a different SIS file from the available ones.

Currently, every Ped release includes SIS files for:

==S60 3rd edition, no caps (3rdEd_no_caps)==

  * Use this build if you have a phone supporting S60 3rd edition platform (all newer S60 phones).
  * This build doesn't have any additional Symbian OS capabilities enabled which means that you may not be able to execute scripts from it that make use of some of your phone's features.
  * It can be installed and used right after downloading.
  * It uses a unique UID which makes sure that it won't interfere with any other application installed on your phone.

  * Use this build if you have a phone supporting S60 3rd edition platform (all newer S60 phones).

  * To sign it, go to [https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do Open Signed Online], enter the IMEI number of your phone (enter *#06# on the standby screen to get it), your e-mail, select the downloaded SIS file and select *all* capabilities. You will receive a link to your signed SIS file in an e-mail.

==S60 2nd edition (2ndEd)==
